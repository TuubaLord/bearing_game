# Bearing Game

A tiny HTML + JavaScript game where you keep a rotating inner bearing away from the outer ring by firing four air jets (Q, W, E, R). Random impacts shove the bearing off-center—survive as long as you can.

## Play
1. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
2. Press **Space** to start.
3. Use **Q W E R** to fire the air tanks and nudge the bearing back to the center.
4. If the inner ring touches the outer ring, the round ends. Press **Space** to try again.

The layout and colors follow the supplied reference graphic.
